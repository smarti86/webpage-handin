        <h1> Handin Webpage</h1>
        <div class="about-section">
            <p>Hello! I'm Sandra and I initially set out to my the website of my favorite
                consignment shop, The Elite Repeat, more accessible. I've been shopping at The 
                Elite Repeat for a decade with my mom, and while at home for the long weekend 
                this semester, we decided to visit once more. However, with their popularity comes
                crazy hours. "Why don't you check the website and see the hours there" my mom suggested
                after a failed attempt at calling the store to see if it was open. When I did check
                The Elite Repeat website, I was horrified by how outdatted and hard it was to find the hours information. 
                With this assignment around the corner I decided to pick on the website and do something 
                about the bad design and low visual contrast. <br> </p>
        </div>
       
        <h1>Figma Mockup vs Implementation</h1>
        <div class="changes-section">
            <p> When working on the header + navigation bar for my website, I deviated from my Figma mockup
                by adding a navigation bar to go to the "about" "directions" "hours" and "contact us" section
                faster. This increased accessiblity and eased navigation because the user can now look at the navigation bar, click
                on the information they are looking for, and they are be automatically scrolled down to that part
                of the webpage. <br>
            </p>
            <div class="banner">
                
                
                <img src="assets/Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 8.46.26 AM.png" alt="Banner Image">

            </div>
            <p> <br>Because I added the navigation bar in my implemention, I decided to inverte the 
                light blue background for the dark blue background, as seen above. This helped increase the visual contrast. 
                The header text is more legible in white than it was in black. <br>
                <br>I also changed my font from JejuMyeongjo to Arial, sans-serif. While the JejuMyeongjo was pretty,
                it was too thin and when I added font weight, the letters blended together. To keep it simple and to maximize
                visual contrast, I decided to change the font to Arial, sans-serif. Similarly, I abandoned the orange
                hues in the color scheme of my visual style guide because the WaveAIM report marked the orange hues as low contrast. 
                When I created my color scheme, I wasn't considering visual contrast as much as I was aesthetics. To find a new pop of color,
                I looked a the central image of the three stylish women around the couch and pulled the maroon color from there.<br>
                <br>Next, in my visual style guide, I designated three images to be images as my assets:
            </p>
            <div class="banner">
                <img src="assets/Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 9.04.33 AM.png" alt="Banner Image"> <br>
            </div>
            <p>
                However, in my implementation, I decided to showcase the image below of the three stylish women around the couch with lots of colors and movement so that there is more
                contrast from the other elements in the webpage. 
            </p>
            <div class="banner">
                <img src="assets/Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 9.06.45 AM.png" alt="Banner Image"> <br>
            </div>
            <p> 
                Although I decided to mock up the image section of the webpage, I would have added the additional images below so that the images 
                would alternate when they are hovered over in my functional implementation. These images would be my new 'brand assets.'
            </p>

            </div>

            <p> 
                The rest of my webpage implementation was close to what I designed in my Figma mockup. I did change the layout of pages and added shadows 
                to increase visual contrast and ultimately make the page more legible.

                    iPad Mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro. If I were to take another stab at this, I would scale and test
                    my application for more Android products.

                    <br> Outside of the occasional online shopping during lecture, this application of shopping and CS was 
                    a very fun assignment. I am very pleased by how I took the website of one of my favorite stores, created low-fidelity 
                    and high-fidelity mockups, and then adjusted them to create a website that maximized accessibility.
